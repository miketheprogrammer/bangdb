bangdb

(Not Ready for Public Use Yet)
Specific API Readme to come.


BangDb bindings for NodeJS. 

Much of the source code is derived from the [node-leveldown](https://github.com/rvagg/node-leveldown)Project.

This project is not the backend bangdb for LevelUp. That is a seperate project with a dependency on these bindings.
